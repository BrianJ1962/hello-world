# BrianJ1962 - who, what, when, where, why?

# Who
Retired programmer, minecrafter, YouTuber, producer and (local) radio personality ... ish.

# what
Primarily, and initially, Minecraft mod's in an effort to rebuild programming skillsets.

# when
Following an extended period of ill-health, during which those skillsets were lost.

# where
Radio - The Wub Factor on Wolfman Radio (www.wolfmanradio.com)
Minecraft - hopefuly back on YouTube soon (www.youtube.com/BrianJ1962/)
            and, if things go well, maybe Twitch (www.twitch.tv/BrianJ1962)
Music - longjohnsliver.bandcamp.com

# why
Because when I used to work as a programmer, it wasn't 'work,' it was 'fun.' I miss that.
